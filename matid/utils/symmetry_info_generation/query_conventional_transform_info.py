This script is used to determine the transform from the system specififed by
first Hall number in each space group, into the system that correponds to the
conventional settings for that space group.

This information is needed because the normalizers and Wyckoff positions in
Bilbao Crystallographic Server are given in the conventional setttings only by
default.
