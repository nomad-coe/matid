# Dimensionality Analysis
MatID can be used to find out the dimensionality of an atomistic geometry.  It
should be noted that MatID does not consider the shape or size of a structure
when assigning dimensionality, but instead looks at  __the number of dimensions
in which the structure is connected to itself through periodic boundary
conditions__. This definition is often relevant for atomistic simulations with
periodic boundary conditions, but may not be useful in other contexts where e.g.
the shape is the deciding factor.

To determine the dimensionality of a system, MatID uses a modified version of the
topological scaling algorithm (TSA)[^1]. The algorithm is based on analyzing
the size scaling of atomic clusters when going from the original system to a
bigger supercell of the same system. With TSA, the dimensionality $D$ is
given by

$$
	D=\begin{cases}
		n_\text{pbc}-\log_n (N_{n}) \text{, when}~n_\text{pbc} \neq 0  \\
		0\text{, when}~n_\text{pbc} = 0
	\end{cases}
$$

where $N_n$ is the number of clusters in a supercell that is repeated
$n$ times in each periodic direction and $n_\mathrm{pbc}$ is the
number of periodic dimensions. For the clustering we use the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)[^2] data clustering algorithm.
The advantage of this algorithm is that it does not require an initial guess
for the number of clusters and it can find arbitrarily shaped clusters. The
clustering requires that we define a metric for the distance between atoms. We
use the following metric:

$$
   d_{ij} = \lvert \vec{R}_i - \vec{R}_j \rvert^{\text{MIC}} - r_i - r_j
$$

where $\vec{R}_i$ and $\vec{R}_j$ are the cartesian positions of atom $i$ and
$j$, respectively, and $r_i$ and $r_j$ are their radii. The radii definition can
be changed and defaults to covalent radii[^3]. It is important to notice that in
this metric the distances always follow the minimum image convention (MIC), i.e.
the distance is calculated between two closest periodic neighbours. By using the
distance to the closest periodic neighbour we obtain the correct clusters
regardless of what shape of cell is used in the original simulation.

The clustering uses two parameters: the minimum cluster size
$n_\mathrm{min}$ and the neighbourhood radius $\epsilon$. We set
$n_\mathrm{min}$ to 1 to allow clusters consisting of even single atoms
and $\epsilon$ defaults to 3.5 Å. At present, a system, in which there is
more than one cluster in the original non-repeated system ($N_1 \gt 1$),
is classified as unknown. Such a case corresponds to systems with multiple
components that are spatially separated, such as a molecule far above a
surface, low density gases, widely spaced clusters in vacuum, etc.

The following code illustrates how dimensionality detection can be performed for
any atomistic structure with MatID.

If you wish to get the dimensionality of a [`Cluster`](/docs/reference/cluster) object, then you can
directly use the [`Cluster.get_dimensionality()`](/docs/reference/cluster#get_dimensionality) method, which is essentially a
shortcut to the [`matid.geometry.get_dimensionality()`](/docs/reference/geometry#get_dimensionality) function.
