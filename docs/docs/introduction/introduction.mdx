# Introduction
MatID is a Python package for identifying and analyzing atomistic systems based on their structure. MatID is designed to help researchers in the automated analysis and labeling of atomistic data.

The package comes with different tools that can be connected together to form a
workflow for analyzing structures. Here is a brief list of the different tools
and their functionality, you can get more details in the **Learn** section of
the docs.

- [Symmetry-based Clustering](../learn/symmetry-based-clustering): Used to identify and report repeating structures in
the given atomistic system. Works both with finite and periodic systems.
- [Symmetry Analysis](../learn/symmetry-analysis/symmetry-analyzer): Routines for analyzing the symmetry of structures. Can be used to return a highly unique conventional cell, detailed Wyckoff position information etc.
- [Dimensionality Analysis](../learn/dimensionality): Used to determine the intended dimensionality of a system taking periodic boundary conditions into account.

As a user, you are free to choose one or many of these tools for your analysis
purposes. A small example that combines several of the provided tools for
analysing an existing structure file is shown below
